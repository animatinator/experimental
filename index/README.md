# Inverted indices

This module generates inverted indices for text files and allows you to search based on the result.

Usage: pass in a series of filenames to construct the index. Then, enter a search query to search the resulting index,
or enter 'q' to quit.

Basic files for testing are provided in the `data` directory.
